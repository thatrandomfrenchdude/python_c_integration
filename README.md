# Python Integration for C/C++

## Description
This code demonstrates how to call a Python script from a C/C++ program. This can be implemented on Mac/Linux.

The existing example calls two scripts to run in the background, specifying that the second can only run after the first. The first script creates a file and writes the sum of two values received from the C/C++ call, and the second script opens the file (which must already exist) and print the square of the value it reads.

## Usage
Add the C/C++ code to your project, changing the command to suit your application.
